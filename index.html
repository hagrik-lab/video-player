<p>Being human is the meaning of the Metro series of games. That is why Metro broadcasts the idea of the need not
   only to preserve humanity in itself, but also to understand other people. In each game, the player must earn
    so-called "karma" to get a good ending. The obvious actions that need to be taken for this are to help those 
    in need and to spare the enemies.</p>
